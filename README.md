# Wine_Color_and_Quality_Prediction_Using_Machine_Learning
I set out to study whether several chemical characteristics such as acidity, sugar and pH can be used to predict the color (White/Red) and Quality (1-10[int]).
Decision Tree classification technique was found to reliably predict the Color dependent variable at 99% accuracy. It was found that ‘TotalSulfurDioxide’ and ‘Chlorides’ were the two most input variables that of this model.
Linear regression was used to predict the Quality dependent variable. After testing several input variables using the scatter plot, ‘FixedAcidity’, ‘VolatileAcidity’, ‘Alcohol’ were selected as the input variable for linear regression and R-squared value was 0.26.
In conclusion, chemical characteristics of wine can be used to reliably predict the color of the wine, but not the quality.
